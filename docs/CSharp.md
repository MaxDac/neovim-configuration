# C# configuration using NeoVim

To run the C# language server, OmniSharp is needed, and the `OmniSharp` executable must be installed and available in the path.
The configuration does not specify any folder, so it may be necessary to define a symbolic link to it.
OmniSharp installation description can be found [here](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases), 
in short download the dotnet version of the binaries, and install them on the usr local folder, 
and create a symbolic link.

Example download name: `omnisharp-linux-x64-net6.0.tar.gz`
